When R is started, a workspace is created and that workspace is where the user creates and manipulates variables. This workspace is an environment, and an environment is a set of
bindings of names, or symbols, to values. The top-level workspace can be
accessed through its name, which is `.GlobalEnv`.

Assignment creates a binding between a symbol and a value, in a particular environment.
